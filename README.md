## How to Run

- Download the raw dataset from Kaggle and place it under `data/raw/`.
- Run the notebooks sequentially:
  - `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`
  - `02_eda.ipynb`
  - `03_modeling.ipynb`
  - `04_summary.ipynb`
- View visualizations in the `visuals/` folder.
- Refer to the final report in `reports/` for conclusions and recommendations.

## 👥 Team & Roles

- Yogesh – Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Meghesh – Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Aishwarya – Modeling & Reporting  

## 📅 Timeline & Milestones

- Weeks 2–4: Dataset exploration, team setup, and initial brainstorming  
- Weeks 5–6: Data cleaning, EDA, model development, and collaborative coding  
- Week 7: Final report writing and presentation recording  

## 🧠 AI Usage

Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot were used for code suggestions and documentation.  
All AI-generated content was reviewed and adapted by the team to ensure understanding and correctness.
