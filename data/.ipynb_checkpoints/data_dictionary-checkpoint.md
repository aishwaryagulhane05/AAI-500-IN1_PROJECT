### `raw/`

* Contains the **original, unmodified datasets** downloaded directly from Kaggle or other sources.
* Acts as the source of truth to always go back to the untouched data.
* Keeps your workflow reproducible by preserving the initial dataset.

### `processed/`

* Contains **cleaned and transformed versions** of the datasets.
* Data here is ready for analysis or modeling after steps like:

  * Missing value imputation
  * Feature engineering
  * Encoding categorical variables
  * Normalization/scaling
* Separate from `raw/` to ensure raw data remains unchanged.
