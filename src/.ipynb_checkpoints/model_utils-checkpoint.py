# Contains helper functions for modeling and evaluation.

# Examples:
## Functions to train models with given hyperparameters.
## Cross-validation routines.
## Functions to calculate performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, AUC).
## Model saving/loading utilities.
## Hyperparameter tuning wrappers.

# Centralizes modeling logic for easier experimentation and reproducibility.
